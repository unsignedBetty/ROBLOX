# ExploitAPI By Betty.

If you use ExploitAPI, don't forget to add Betty to credits.
If you don't, your exploit will be remotely disabled.

# How to use ?

First of all, after importing the DLL (will edit this with the step on how to), you must create a new ExploitAPI instance.

```cpp
ExploitAPI EXPLOITNAME;
```
Once that done, you must initialize the exploit with a new instance name.
```cpp
EXPLOITNAME.Init("INSTANCE NAME");
```
Next steps will come soon.

# What are the functions and what does they return ?

There are all the usable function for now:

```cpp
ExploitAPI test;
test.Init("test"); //Returns INIT_SUCCESS if worked, Returns INIT_FAIL if failed.
test.RegisterAddress(0x111111, "Address Name") //Returns REG_SUCCESS if worked, Returns REG_FAIL if failed.
test.GetAddress("Registered Address Name"); //Returns the address if it exists, Returns GET_FAIL if failed.
```
Will add the new functions when the lib will update.
